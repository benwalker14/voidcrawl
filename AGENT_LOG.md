# Voidcrawl Agent Activity Log

### 2026-03-20 00:00 | developer | Initial project setup
- Scaffolded Next.js 16 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS 4
- Built core game engine: dungeon generation, combat, FOV, rendering
- Created playable MVP with procedural dungeons, enemies, and floor progression
- Set up agent infrastructure (CLAUDE.md, TASK_BOARD.md, etc.)

### 2026-03-20 12:00 | reporter | Daily report
- Read AGENT_LOG.md, TASK_BOARD.md, FINANCES.md, HUMAN_INBOX.md
- Wrote daily report to HUMAN_INBOX.md
- Noted: no agent activity beyond initial developer setup; health/designer/strategist/reporter have not yet run
- Flagged 3 decisions for human: production URL, scheduler verification, ESLint config commit

### 2026-03-20 18:00 | developer | Item/loot system implementation
- Added item type system: weapons, armor, potions with Common/Uncommon/Rare rarities
- Created 13 item templates scaling across floor tiers (5 weapons, 5 armor, 3 potions)
- Implemented loot drop system: enemies have 35-60% chance to drop items on death
- Items render on the dungeon floor with rarity-colored symbols (/ weapons, [ armor, ! potions)
- Auto-pickup: walking over items equips if better, or adds to inventory
- Auto-equip: weapons/armor auto-equip when picked up if stronger than current
- Equipment bonuses apply to combat (attack from weapons, defense from armor)
- Inventory system: 8 slots, press 1-8 to use items (potions heal, equipment swaps)
- HUD now shows ATK/DEF stats and equipped weapon/armor names
- Inventory panel appears below canvas when items are held
- Fixed pre-existing ESLint issue (setState in useEffect) with eager initialization
- Lint and build both pass clean

### 2026-03-20 22:00 | developer | Experience points and leveling system
- Added PlayerProgression type (level, xp, xpToNext) to GameState
- Added xpReward field to GameEntity and enemy templates (5-75 base XP per enemy type)
- XP scales with floor depth alongside enemy stats (×1.15 per floor)
- XP to next level formula: 10 + level × 15 (level 2 = 25 XP, level 3 = 40 XP, etc.)
- On level up: +5 max HP, +1 ATK, +1 DEF, full heal, celebratory message
- XP awarded on enemy kill with message log feedback (+N XP)
- HUD shows Level indicator and animated XP progress bar (gold/yellow theme)
- Death screen now shows level reached alongside floor and turns
- Progression persists across floor transitions
- Lint and build both pass clean

### 2026-03-20 23:30 | developer | Enemy AI overhaul: pathfinding and behaviors
- Created A* pathfinding module (src/game/pathfinding.ts) with binary min-heap
  - findPath(): returns next step toward goal, navigates around walls/corridors
  - findFleeStep(): finds best adjacent tile to move away from a target
  - Search depth capped at 30 steps for performance
- Added AIBehavior enum with 4 behavior types:
  - CHASE: Standard A* pursuit (Void Walker, Abyssal Hound, Rift Wraith, Void Lord)
  - WANDER: Random movement until player is spotted, then pathfind chase (Void Rat, Void Beetle)
  - AMBUSH: Stationary until player enters short detect range, then aggressive (Dark Slime, Shade)
  - COWARD: Chase normally but flee when below 40% HP (Shadow Wisp)
- Added per-enemy detection ranges (3-16 tiles) instead of uniform 8-tile range
  - Short range: Dark Slime (3), Shade (4), Void Rat (5) — must get close to trigger
  - Long range: Abyssal Hound (12), Rift Wraith (14), Void Lord (16) — sense player from far away
- Rewrote moveEnemies() to use behavior-driven AI with pathfinding
- Enemies now properly navigate corridors, doorways, and around obstacles
- Blocked position tracking prevents enemies from stacking on same tile
- Lint and build both pass clean

### 2026-03-20 24:00 | strategist | Player Experience analysis (first strategist session)
- Performed comprehensive UX audit across 10 dimensions: controls, HUD, feedback, onboarding, death/restart, accessibility, mobile, visual clarity, performance, landing page
- **Top findings (highest impact-to-effort):**
  1. No help system — players have no way to learn game mechanics, enemy types, item rarities, or combat formulas. A press-? help overlay is low-effort, high-impact
  2. No visual combat feedback — all feedback is text-only in message log. Floating damage numbers and color-coded messages would dramatically improve game feel
  3. Mobile completely broken — no viewport meta tag, no touch controls. Game is unplayable on phones
  4. Death screen is bare — shows level/floor/turns but no run summary. Adding kill count, items found, and personal bests would increase "one more run" motivation
  5. No pause menu — no way to access help, restart, or quit mid-game
  6. Text too small — HUD and message log use 12px text, hard to read
  7. No stat comparisons — when finding items, player can't compare to current gear without memorizing stats
  8. No accessibility features — zero screen reader support, no colorblind mode
- Added 14 new tasks to TASK_BOARD.md across P1 (5), P2 (6), P3 (3) priorities
- Flagged mobile support question for human decision (HUMAN_INBOX.md)
- No money spent
